You can only build a block if it is next to a already existing block, a platform or the ground.

Main known bugs:
If you restart the game the building range won't be displayed but you can still build in the same way.


Others:
Enemies AI not completed.
Settings button do not work.
UI not completed.
Enemies will be able to break blocks.
Reload wont be displayed but trust us...it works ;P
